# Encarvlucas Balatro Mods
Mods I made for the awesome game [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/).

## Enchanted Deck
Start the game with some of your cards already be enhanced!

Odds are (check mod files as these are subject to change):
- 20% that a card is **_enhanced_**
- 8% that a card has a **_special edition_**
- 8% that a card has a **_seal_**
